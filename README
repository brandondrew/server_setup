####################################################################


# This is (currently) a very basic script.
# It will have to be moved from github before
#  I add any sensitive data (private keys, etc.)
# If you have any good ideas for making this repo public, 
#  but making .ssh directory and such things stored elsewhere,
#  with making the script painful or useles, let me know please.


### Goals ###
# install packages I want
# synchronize data I want on my servers
# set up my preferences/configurations for things like zsh, emacs, git
